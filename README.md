#### General Information

An application created in my Human Computer Interaction Course -
it is angled to assist freshman commuter students make friends and
meet like-minded people.

#### Technologies Used

* Storyboard
* Axure

#### Special Note:

My team and I received the highest grade for our project in this Human Computer Interaction Course.

#### How many Team Members were there?

There were a total of 8 Team Members.

#### Aim of CollegeVibes

The aim of CollegeVibes was for Freshman Commuter Students at Montclair State University to utilize their pockets of free time throughout the day to converse with friends and like-minded peers.

#### What is the problem and how does CollegeVibes solve it?

Problem: First year non transfer commuter students find it difficult to utilize their pockets of free time throughout the day to their advantage to meet and make friends with their classmates.

CollegeVibes Solution: CollegeVibes is a social media platform that allows for students to utilize their pockets of free time to befriend classmates, start a conversation with an Icebreaker if they are unsure how to initiate the conversation, and view real-time statuses made.

#### Interview Stage
For this stage, we had to think of questions to ask interviewees centeralizing on the routes they take to make friends. After
interviewing 3 students at Montclair State University, we then proceeded to find patterns in their responses to
the questions we asked:

Everyone has this in common: Would like to have that chance to make friends but there isnâ€™t that leisure of time. (i.e. full time student, full time/part time job, or taking care of children)

Two of the interviewees had this in common: Use social media on a daily to keep up with friends.
Two of the interviewees had this in common: Go to class, and then leave to mmediately get started on the assignment given. They would make a friend in class only if they HAD to. (i.e. group project)
Everyone had this in common: Met their closest friends in person not through social media online.

#### What was the Target Demographic?

First-year non-transfer commuters at Montclair State University.

#### Raw Materials
The goal was to find 5 websites and/or applications and select a 'Big Idea' from each that we thought would be useful to our CollgeVibes solution. In the PDF below, there are slides dedicated to explaining how the 'Big Idea' worked in the application/website as well as Pros & Cons of applying the 'Big Idea' to our application.

The 5 websites and/or apps we selected were: Tinder, ASOS, Instagram, LinkedIn, Canvas.

#### How many personas did we create? 
We created three personas:

<a href = "Persona1.pdf">Mason Cooper </a>

<a href = "Persona2.pdf"> April Johnson </a>


<a href = "Persona3.pdf"> Mariam Rashid </a>

To view the Problem and Context Scenario accompanying each, click on their respective images to be taken to the PDF. 

##### Do any of the Personas have Storyboards?
Yes, <a href = "Persona1.pdf"> Mason Cooper </a> is the only persona who has a storyboard in his PDF.

#### Was CollegeVibes tested on actual students?
Yes, we tailored the application to show a student's interests and used the Think Aloud Protocol.

In <a class = "link_pdf_color" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr4zV6xKlZI"> this YouTube video, </a> a fellow teammate - Sarah Fathelbab - is using the Think Aloud Protocol.

We test the main features of the CollegeVibes application and how the student interacted with the application as a whole.

The College Vibes Prototype provided below is the prototype that was tailored towards this specific student.
